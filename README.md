# README



* This assignment was writen in NodeJS (version 8.12), as text editor I used Sublime text. 

* It finds and counts the values from the data.JASON that matches with the user input.
* ex. when you type: "Inuput" or "Box", it will give you the results found. For value "Input" it should return resoult 26, for "Box" it should return resoult 5.

* Below are some of the comments that I also inserted at the index.js

//require fs and readline to make it available input from command line
// read file and parse JSON data from file named data.json from the example
// when user enters characters (stdin)
// calling function searchSelector
// generating result for found results
// counter for how many matching element found
// loop the current level
// if the current value is equeal to stdin (inserter characters)
// increment found results
// stdout found result
// if type of value is array or object, so continue looping to those elements
